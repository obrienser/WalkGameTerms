        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 28.11.2025</p>

        <p>
            These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your use of the iOS application 
            <strong>“Walk Game”</strong> (the “<strong>App</strong>”), provided by the individual that publishes
            Walk Game in the Apple App Store (the “<strong>Developer</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”).
            By downloading, installing, or using the App, you (“<strong>you</strong>”, “<strong>user</strong>”) agree to be bound by these Terms.
            If you do not agree, do not download, install, or use the App.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please also read our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, which describes how the App handles your data.
            The Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility and Use by Children</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The App is designed to be suitable for children under Apple’s guidelines. However,
                the legal agreement described in these Terms is intended to be made with an adult (such as a parent or guardian).
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are under the age of majority in your country, you may use the App only with the consent and 
                under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian, who accepts these Terms on your behalf and is 
                responsible for your use of the App.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents and guardians are responsible for supervising their children’s use of the App, the device,
                and related Apple services (such as Apple ID and iCloud).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. License to Use the App</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive,
                non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download and use the App on iOS devices 
                that you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use.
            </li>
            <li>
                The App is licensed, not sold, to you. All rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms
                are reserved by the Developer.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may not:
                <ul>
                    <li>Copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the App.</li>
                    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App, except where allowed by applicable law.</li>
                    <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices in the App.</li>
                    <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Accounts and Profiles</h2>
        <p>
            The App includes in-app account functionality and uses Apple’s services (such as iCloud) to manage profiles and game data.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The App may use a user identifier (for example, an identifier linked to your Apple ID or iCloud account)
                and a display name that you can change within the App’s settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may have the option to create, duplicate, or manage accounts/profiles inside the App. You are responsible
                for the use of the App under your device and Apple ID.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must keep your device secure and not allow unauthorized persons to access the App or your Apple ID.
                If you become aware of any unauthorized use, you should secure your device and Apple ID (for example, by changing passwords).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Health, Safety and No Medical Advice</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses your walking and running distance (including via HealthKit) to provide game-related features, statistics,
            and progress tracking. It is not a medical or fitness advisory tool.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The App does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is not a substitute
                for professional medical advice from a doctor or other healthcare provider.
            </li>
            <li>
                Always consult a healthcare professional before starting or changing any exercise or fitness program.
                If you feel any discomfort, pain, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms while walking or exercising,
                stop and seek medical advice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not use the App in situations where distraction or looking at your device could be dangerous 
                (for example, while driving, cycling, or crossing streets).
            </li>
            <li>
                You are responsible for using the App in a safe manner and for ensuring that any physical activity
                you perform is appropriate for your health and fitness level.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Location, HealthKit and Data Handling</h2>
        <p>
            The App may use your location and HealthKit data as described in the Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Location data is collected and stored on your device and/or in your iCloud account 
                to calculate and display your in-game progress (for example, walked areas, visited locations).
            </li>
            <li>
                HealthKit data is limited to walking/running distance, and is used to calculate in-game progress,
                statistics, and scores. Raw HealthKit data remains under Apple’s control in the Health app.
            </li>
            <li>
                By enabling location services and HealthKit permissions for the App, you consent to the use of such data
                as described in both these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can disable or modify permissions at any time in your device settings, but certain features of the App
                may not function properly without these permissions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Fees and In-App Purchases (if applicable)</h2>
        <p>
            The App may be offered free of charge or may include optional in-app purchases or other paid features,
            depending on your version and region.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any payments for in-app purchases are processed by Apple via the App Store. We do not process or store your payment information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Purchases made through the App are generally final and non-refundable, except where required by applicable law
                or by Apple’s refund policies.
            </li>
            <li>
                We reserve the right to change prices, introduce new features or tiers, or modify existing features,
                to the extent permitted by applicable law.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Acceptable Use and Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the App. In particular, you agree that you will not:</p>

            <li>Access or attempt to access data of other users without their permission.</li>
            <li>Introduce malware, viruses, or other harmful code into the App or related systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All intellectual property rights in and to the App, including its design, code, graphics, text,
                and other content, are owned by the Developer or its licensors and are protected by copyright,
                trademark, and other laws.
            </li>
            <li>
                You obtain no ownership rights in the App or any part of it. You may use the App only as expressly permitted
                by these Terms and applicable Apple and App Store terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you submit about the App may be used by us without obligation to you,
                including without compensation, and you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
                to use such feedback for any purpose.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services and Apple</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The App relies on third-party services provided by Apple, including but not limited to iCloud,
                HealthKit, the App Store, and possibly other Apple frameworks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your use of those services is also governed by Apple’s own terms and policies. We are not responsible 
                for Apple’s services, their availability, or any errors or issues that arise from them.
            </li>
            <li>
                The App does not include general web browsing or open internet access and does not integrate 
                third-party advertising or tracking SDKs, as described in the Privacy Policy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You may stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device. You may also be able to 
                delete your in-app account and related data through the App’s settings, as described in the Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may suspend or terminate your access to the App, or discontinue the App entirely, at any time and for any reason,
                including if we believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upon termination, the license granted to you in Section 2 will automatically end. Some provisions of these Terms 
                (including, for example, those relating to intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and 
                governing law) will continue to apply even after termination.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App is provided on an “<strong>as is</strong>” 
                and “<strong>as available</strong>” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory.
            </li>
            <li>
                We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that any defects will be corrected.
            </li>
            <li>
                We make no warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information or statistics
                generated by the App (including distance measurements, maps, game progress, or health-related metrics).
            </li>
            <li>
                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not 
                apply to you. In that case, the warranties will be limited to the minimum legally required.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, 
                special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, loss of profits, or other intangible losses,
                arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the App.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the extent permitted by law, our total aggregate liability for any claims related to the App or these Terms
                will be limited to the amount you actually paid (if any) for use of the App in the 12 months preceding the event 
                giving rise to the claim, or a reasonable equivalent where such limitation is not allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law,
                such as liability for intentional misconduct or for injury caused by gross negligence where such limitations are not allowed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
            To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Developer from and against any
            claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or connected with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your violation of these Terms or applicable law.</li>
            <li>Your misuse of the App.</li>
            <li>Any content or actions related to your use of the App that infringe the rights of a third party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>14. Changes to the App and to These Terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We may update the App from time to time, for example to add or remove features, fix bugs, or improve performance.
                Some updates may be required to continue using the App.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may modify these Terms from time to time. When we do so, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you continue to use the App after the Terms have been updated, you are deemed to have accepted the updated Terms.
                If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the App and delete it from your devices.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To the extent permitted by law, these Terms and your use of the App are governed by the laws of 
                <strong>Ukraine</strong>, without regard to its conflict-of-law rules.
                You should replace this with the appropriate jurisdiction before publishing.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are a consumer in the European Economic Area, the UK, or another region with mandatory consumer protection laws,
                you may also be entitled to the protection of the mandatory provisions of the laws of your country of residence.
            </li>
            <li>
                You and the Developer agree to attempt to resolve any disputes amicably. If this is not possible,
                disputes may be brought before the competent courts in the jurisdiction specified above, subject to
                any mandatory rights you have under applicable consumer laws.
            </li>
        </ul>
