        <h1>Walk Game – Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 28.11.2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how the iOS application <strong>“Walk Game”</strong> 
            (“the App”, “we”, “us”) handles your data. The App is designed to keep your 
            information as local and private as possible and to rely mainly on 
            <strong>Apple’s iCloud and HealthKit</strong>. The App is available 
            <strong>only on iOS</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>
            The data controller for the App is the individual that publishes 
            <strong>Walk Game</strong> in the Apple App Store (“Developer”, “we”, “us”).
        </p>

        <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The App collects and uses only the minimum data required to function:
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Location Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>What:</strong> Your approximate or precise geographic location while 
                you use the App (and, if you grant background access, also when the App is 
                running in the background), depending on your iOS location settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Where it is stored:</strong> Location-related data is stored 
                <strong>only in your personal iCloud account</strong> (via Apple’s CloudKit / iCloud services) 
                and/or <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not store your location data on our own servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>For what purpose:</strong> To calculate and display your progress in the game 
                (for example, walked areas, visited locations, in-game progress) and to provide 
                game features related to walking and movement.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Health Data (HealthKit)</h3>
        <p>The App integrates with <strong>Apple HealthKit</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>What we read from HealthKit:</strong> The 
                <strong>distance you walk or run per day</strong> (for example, meters walked or run).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What we do not access from HealthKit:</strong> We do not access heart rate, weight, 
                medical records, or any other HealthKit categories.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Where it is stored:</strong> The raw HealthKit data remains in the 
                <strong>Health app</strong> on your device, controlled by Apple. We may store 
                <strong>derived values</strong> (for example, total meters walked for the day, 
                game points based on that distance) in your <strong>local app storage</strong> and/or 
                your <strong>iCloud account</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>For what purpose:</strong> To calculate your in-game progress, achievements, 
                and scores, and to show statistics related to your daily walking or running distance 
                inside the App.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>HealthKit usage commitments (required by Apple):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We only read your walking/running distance from HealthKit and use it to provide health, fitness, and game-related functionality within the App.</li>
            <li>We do not use HealthKit data for advertising, marketing, or profiling.</li>
            <li>We do not sell, share, or transfer HealthKit data to third parties.</li>
            <li>We do not use HealthKit data for data mining or building external profiles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Account and Profile Data</h3>
        <p>The App includes in-app account functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>What we collect:</strong> A user identifier (for example, a unique ID associated with your iCloud 
                or in-app account), your <strong>display name</strong> (which you can change in the account settings), and 
                information about your <strong>accounts/profiles</strong> inside the App (for example, if you create or 
                duplicate another account/profile).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Where it is stored:</strong> This information is stored 
                <strong>securely in your iCloud account</strong> and/or <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not 
                maintain separate backend servers with your profile data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>For what purpose:</strong> To let you sign in to the App, identify your profile, and sync your 
                progress across your own devices (via iCloud), and to support features like renaming your account and 
                duplicating your account/profile inside the App.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>We use the data described above strictly for the following purposes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If enabled, your game data and account information sync across your devices through Apple’s iCloud services.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Maintaining security and integrity of your account</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring your data is accessible only to you (or anyone who has access to your Apple ID / device, as controlled by you).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

            <li>Building commercial profiles outside the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, or similar jurisdictions, 
            our legal bases for processing your personal data are the performance of a contract 
            (to provide the App and its features), your consent (for Location and HealthKit access), 
            and our legitimate interests (for securing and maintaining the App).
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>On-device storage:</strong> Some data (such as app settings and cached progress) is stored locally on your iOS device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>iCloud storage:</strong> Game progress, account data, and some location-related or Health-derived values are stored in

            <li>
                <strong>No own servers:</strong> We do not operate separate external servers with your personal data. Data is stored either on

                <strong>Security:</strong> We rely on Apple’s security infrastructure (device encryption, iCloud security, HealthKit protections) 
                and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental loss, destruction, or unauthorized access to your data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please remember that the security of your data also depends on you, for example by using a strong passcode 
            and keeping your Apple ID secure.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is designed to comply with Apple’s guidelines for apps suitable for children.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect personal information from children beyond what is necessary

            <li>The App does not include open internet browsing or third-party advertising or tracking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information beyond 
            what is described in this Policy, please contact us so we can help you understand and manage that data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on your region, parental consent or involvement may be required for children under a certain age. 
            You are responsible for supervising your child’s use of the App and Apple’s services (iCloud, Apple ID, etc.).
        </p>
